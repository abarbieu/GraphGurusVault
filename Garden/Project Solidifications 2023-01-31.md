So far we have solidified the project a bit and assigned individual focuses.
Project Idea:
- Create word embeddings using OpenAI for the notes in an Obsidian vault.
- Use these embeddings to display notes in a static 2D space (may require significant additional analysis). 
- Visualize this 2D space as a procedurally generated map to tie  topics (+notes if you zoom in) to distinct objects in semantic space.
- **Example:** An pink island with sharp edges represents daily life notes, on it is a peninsula that is more orange and round which contains content recommendations (films etc). On the other side of the map there is a large land mass where scientific notes are, within it are countries, regions, etc. which are scientific fields.
	- The spatial organization is determined by OpenAIs embeddings, on which a sort of hierarchical clustering is performed.
	- The shapes and colors are procedurally generated ius
