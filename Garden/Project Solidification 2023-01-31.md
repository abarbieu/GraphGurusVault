So far we have solidified the project a bit and assigned individual focuses.

### Project Idea:
- Create text embeddings using OpenAI for the notes in an Obsidian vault.
- Use these embeddings to display notes in a static 2D space (may require significant additional analysis). 
- Visualize this 2D space as a procedurally generated map to tie  topics (+notes if you zoom in) to distinct objects in semantic space.
- **Example:** An pink island with sharp edges represents daily life notes, on it is a peninsula that is more orange and round which contains content recommendations (films etc). On the other side of the map there is a large land mass where scientific notes are, within it are countries, regions, etc. which are scientific fields.
	- The spatial organization is determined by OpenAIs embeddings, on which a sort of hierarchical clustering is performed.
	- The shapes and colors are procedurally generated using techniques from game design (future work)

## Individual Focuses:
- Kenny: Text embeddings
	- Work on getting an OpenAI account working
	- Analyze the text embeddings - what can we do with them?
	- What sort of OpenAI features might be useful for us?
	- What other projects use embeddings/semantic search? How can we use their work? (Rather than rewriting it)
	- Implementing this side of the project 
	- Make sure this work is usable for the plugin - can this info be sent outside of OpenAI etc.
- Kaanan: Clustering/Visualization
	- Find example embeddings before OpenAI is set up
	- Set up a pipeline for clustering these embeddings hierarchically
		- Will this work for OpenAI embeddings?
	- [[OpenAI Cookbook Example]]
		- [Here is a Github of OpenAI example notebooks, this one clusters embeddings and generates description](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Clustering.ipynb)
	- Display these clusters in 2D space that is static, ensure it is s
