- Fractal Visualiser
	- View the overall graph with subgraphs
	- Give each of these subgraphs a DALLE generated icon - e.g. biology is blue and bubble. 
	- All sub subgraphs receive an icon that is a modification of the super-icon. It takes a blank slate and modulates it in a way that adds information
	- This way each note, subject area, etc. has a unique icon that contains information immediately visually indicative of its content

## Ideas:
Minimap in note
Mindmap resource
Have layers that can be toggled
Islands for subject area life "life org," "academic," "etc"
- Is there a way of lowering "elevation" based on distance so that after a threshold, water is added?
