# Templates
When creating a new note, first insert a template (cmd/ctrl + p -> insert template or bind a hotkey). If there isn't an apt template and you hand-modify one a few times, create a new template.
- For example, if you keep on making "people" notes, you could create a template that includes a "met" date etc. 
- Make sure things are clearly labeled so, if needed in the future, we can write a (short) script to reformat this metadata.


## Tags
Rather than using # tags to organize notes, use internal links to non-existent files. This way, if enough notes point to a topic area, a note can be created with that name that maps out the subject. This allso allows for a better organization of the knowledge graph as it is easy to remove [[no]]
