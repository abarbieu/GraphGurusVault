## Core Features
1.  Automatically turns your Obsidian vault into a semantically organized space
	1.  Requires no manual organization/maintenance of links
3.  Visualizes this space as a static map - it won‚Äôt change each time you load it
	1.  This is like a game map, where islands are topic areas and smaller features are subtopics
	1.  No graphics here, simply dots that are spatially/semantically organized
5.  Updates visualization as more documents are added to the Obsidian vault
6.  Easy installation of our software as a plugin through Obsidian Community Marketplace (or as a beta plugin)
7.  ‚ÄúSemantic space‚Äù means that a region on a 2D plane maps to one topic/note and topics that aren‚Äôt similar map to distant regions
8.  Utilizes our highly evolved viso-spatial foraging capacity
	1.  We are great at remembering layouts and tying memories to objects in these layouts - this is utilized in memorization techniques like the method of Loci
    

## Future Features
1.  Utilize procedural content generation (PCG) to create cluster visualizations for mental mapping
	1.  This looks like a game map, where mountains mean there are a lot of notes in that topic area and deserts/oceans mean there is very little in the semantic space between two topics
3.  Add labels to cluster within knowledge graph for clarity
	1.  Automatically generated using language models and hierarchical levels of specificity
	1.  If you zoom in enough, these labels are note titles or summarizations
5.  Search bar to allow users to semantically search clusters for documents
	1.  Describe what you‚Äôre looking for and get related notes
	2.  Goes beyond Regex and keyword search for large knowledge bases (and forgotten notes)
7.  Mini-map to show user location in knowledge graph
	1.  When in a folder or file, you can learn to associate that part of the map with that region
9.  Customizable visualizations
	1.  If you want one region of the map to look a certain way (colors, terrain type, scale/importance) you can define this in a file linked to the map
11.  Global maps
	1.  View multiple knowledge bases in one map, since semantic areas are universal, other people‚Äôs notes should map to the same areas - compare your vault to others
	2.  Collaborate on a global map and customize your area of contribution
    
## Requirements
1.  Create an API between an Obsidian vault and OpenAI‚Äôs word embedding model
    -   Establish secure, efficient connection between the Obsidian vault and OpenAI‚Äôs word embedding model
    -   Ensure compatibility between the data format of the Obsidian vault and OpenAI‚Äôs word embedding model
2.  Create hierarchical clusters from word embeddings generated by OpenAI
    -   Utilize OpenAI‚Äôs word embedding model to analyze text content within each Obsidian document
    -   Organize the analyzed data into hierarchical clusters based on semantic similarity
3.  Generate unique shapes for subcategories within a cluster
    -   Develop a method to visually differentiate subcategories within a cluster
    -   Ensure the unique shapes are aesthetically pleasing and easily distinguishable
4.  Research data input and output OpenAi‚Äôs word embedding model
    -   Understand how OpenAI‚Äôs word embedding model processes and outputs data
    -   Determine any limitations or constraints of the model‚Äôs data input and output
5.  Research clustering methods
    -   Evaluate different clustering methods to determine the best approach for semantic similarity analysis
    -   Assess the strengths and weaknesses of each clustering method and make an informed decision
6.  Research requirements and format for Obsidian Community Marketplace package
    -   Familiarize yourself with the requirements for submitting a package to the Obsidian Community Marketplace
    -   Ensure the final product meets the necessary requirements and follows the specified format

## Evaluation Criteria
1.  Word embeddings able to be generated from an Obsidian Vault (Testing API)
    -   Verify that word embeddings can be successfully generated from the Obsidian vault through the API connection
    -   Ensure that the API connection and word embedding generation process is reliable and consistent
2.  Collection of documents about two topics correctly separated into two clusters (testing clustering and API)
    -   Test the clustering method on a collection of documents about two distinct topics
    -   Verify that the documents about each topic are correctly separated into two distinct clusters
3.  Creating a complete pipeline to turn a Obsidian Vault into a semantic spatial visualization
    -   Evaluate the entire process, from the API connection to the final visualization
    -   Ensure that the final product is a complete pipeline that transforms an Obsidian vault into a semantic spatial visualization.
