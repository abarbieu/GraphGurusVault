Core Features

1.  Automatically turns your Obsidian vault into a semantically organized space
	1.  Requires no manual organization/maintenance of links
3.  Visualizes this space as a static map - it won’t change each time you load it
	1.  This is like a game map, where islands are topic areas and smaller features are subtopics
	1.  No graphics here, simply dots that are spatially/semantically organized
5.  Updates visualization as more documents are added to the Obsidian vault
6.  Easy installation of our software as a plugin through Obsidian Community Marketplace (or as a beta plugin)
7.  “Semantic space” means that a region on a 2D plane maps to one topic/note and topics that aren’t similar map to distant regions
8.  Utilizes our highly evolved viso-spatial foraging capacity
	1.  We are great at remembering layouts and tying memories to objects in these layouts - this is utilized in memorization techniques like the method of Loci
    

Future Features
1.  Utilize procedural content generation (PCG) to create cluster visualizations for mental mapping
	1.  This looks like a game map, where mountains mean there are a lot of notes in that topic area and deserts/oceans mean there is very little in the semantic space between two topics
3.  Add labels to cluster within knowledge graph for clarity
	1.  Automatically generated using language models and hierarchical levels of specificity
	1.  If you zoom in enough, these labels are note titles or summarizations
5.  Search bar to allow users to semantically search clusters for documents
	1.  Describe what you’re looking for and get related notes
2.  Goes beyond Regex and keyword search for large knowledge bases (and forgotten notes)
    

7.  Mini-map to show user location in knowledge graph
    

1.  When in a folder or file, you can learn to associate that part of the map with that region
    

9.  Customizable visualizations
    

1.  If you want one region of the map to look a certain way (colors, terrain type, scale/importance) you can define this in a file linked to the map
    

11.  Global maps
    

1.  View multiple knowledge bases in one map, since semantic areas are universal, other people’s notes should map to the same areas - compare your vault to others
    
2.  Collaborate on a global map and customize your area of contribution
