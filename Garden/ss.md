Core Features

1.  Generates topic clusters from semantically similar Obsidian documents
    
2.  Creates a semantic spatial visualization of an Obsidian knowledge graph
    
3.  Updates visualization as more documents are added to the Obsidian vault
    
4.  Easy installation of our software as a plugin through Obisdian Community Marketplace
    

Future Features

1.  Utilize procedural content generation (PCG) to create cluster visualizations for mental mapping
    
2.  Add labels to cluster within knowledge graph for clarity
    
3.  Search bar to allow users to semantically search clusters for documents
    
4.  Mini-map to show user location in knowledge graph
    

Requirements

1.  Create an API between an Obisidian vault and OpenAI’s word embedding model
    
2.  Create hierarchical clusters from word embeddings generated by OpenAI
    
3.  Generate unique shapes for subcategories within a cluster
    
4.  Research data input and output OpenAi’s word embedding model
    
5.  Research clustering methods
    
6.  Research requirements and format for Obisidian Community Marketplace package.
    

Evaluation Criteria

1.  Word embeddings able to be generated from an Obsidian Vault (Testing API)
    
2.  Collection of documents about two topics correctly separated into two clusters (testing clustering and API)
    
3.  Creating a complete pipeline to turn a Obsidian Vault into a semantic spatial visualization
